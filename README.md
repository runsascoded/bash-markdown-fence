This package provides 3 CLIs:
- `bmd`: run Bash commands, wrap output for Markdown embedding
  - [`bmdf`](#bmdf), [`bmdff`](#bmdff), [`bmdfff`](#bmdfff): different levels of "fencing" for command output
- `mdcmd`: find `bmd` blocks in Markdown files, execute commands, update Markdown files with output
- `mktoc`: update Markdown table of contents (with custom "id" anchors)

## Install <a id="install"></a>
```bash
pip install bmdf
```

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

### `bmd`: format `bash` command and output as Markdown <a id="bmd"></a>

`bmd` (and aliases [`bmdf`](#bmdf), [`bmdff`](#bmdff), [`bmdfff`](#bmdfff)) takes a `bash` command as input, and renders the command and/or its output in various Markdown-friendly formats:

#### `bmdf` (`bmd -f`): command+output mode <a id="bmdf"></a>

Suppose you want to embed a command and its output in a README.md, like this:

<!-- `bmdf seq 3` -->
```bash
seq 3
# 1
# 2
# 3
```

(Note how the command is `bash`-highlighted, and output lines are rendered as comments)

Put a placeholder like this in your README.md:
  ````
  <!-- `bmdf seq 3` -->
  ````

then [run `mdcmd`](#mdcmd) to update your README containing this embedded command block.

#### `bmdff` (`bmd -ff`): two-fence mode <a id="bmdff"></a>
`bmdff` (alias for `bmd -ff`) renders two code fences, one with the Bash command (syntax-highlighted appropriately), and a second (non-highlighted) block with the output, e.g.:

  ````
  <!-- `bmdff seq 5` -->
  ````

becomes:

<!-- `bmdff seq 5` -->
```bash
seq 5
```
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### `bmdfff` (`bmd -fff`): &lt;details&gt; mode <a id="bmdfff"></a>

When a command's output is large, rendering it as a `<details><summary>` (with the output collapsed, by default) may be preferable.

`bmdfff` (3 `f`s, alias for `bmd -fff`) transforms placeholders like this:

  ````
  <!-- `bmdfff seq 10` -->
  ````

to:

<!-- `bmdfff seq 10` -->
<details><summary><code>seq 10</code></summary>

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
</details>

### `mdcmd`: update commands embedded in Markdown files <a id="mdcmd"></a>

```bash
# Modify README.md in-place
mdcmd -i README.md
# Same as above; no args defaults to `-i README.md`
mdcmd
```

The placeholder block above will now contain `seq 3` and its output; that's how first block above is rendered!

The full README.md block will now look like:
  ````
  <!-- `bmdf seq 3` -->
  ```bash
  seq 3
  # 1
  # 2
  # 3
  ```
  ````

and running `mdcmd` again will rewrite the same content.

Note: `bmdf` (alias for `bmd -f`) is used because it wraps the output of whatever it's passed in a "Bash fence" block. You don't have to use it, but most commands will fail to output a Markdown "fence" block, and subsequent `mdcmd` invocations will fail to parse them.

### `mktoc`: update table of contents <a id="mktoc"></a>
Put a block like this in your README.md:
````
<!-- toc -->
<!-- /toc -->
````

Then put empty `<a>` tags next to the headings you want to include, e.g.:

 ```markdown
 ## My section heading <a id="my-section"></a>
 ```

(This allows for customizing and shortening the `id`s, as well as skipping sections)

Then run:
```bash
# Modify README.md in-place
mktoc -i README.md
# Same as above; no args defaults to `-i README.md`
mktoc
```

And the `<!-- toc  -->` section will have a table of contents injected (like the one at the top of this file).

### Reference <a id="reference"></a>

<!-- `bmdf bmd` -->
```bash
bmd
# Usage: bmd [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...
#
#   Format a command and its output to markdown, either in a `bash`-fence or
#   <details> block, and copy it to the clipboard.
#
# Options:
#   -C, --no-copy  Disable copying output to clipboard (normally uses first
#                  available executable from ['pbcopy', 'xclip', 'clip']
#   -f, --fence    Pass 0-3x to configure output style: 0x: print output lines,
#                  prepended by "# "; 1x: print a "```bash" fence block
#                  including the <command> and commented output lines; 2x: print
#                  a bash-fenced command followed by plain-fenced output lines;
#                  3x: print a <details/> block, with command <summary/> and
#                  collapsed output lines in a plain fence.
#   --help         Show this message and exit.
```

<!-- `bmdf -- mdcmd --help` -->
```bash
mdcmd --help
# Usage: mdcmd [OPTIONS] [PATH] [OUT_PATH]
#
#   Parse a Markdown file, updating blocks preceded by <!-- `[cmd...]` -->
#   delimiters.
#
#   If no paths are provided, will look for a README.md, and operate "in-place"
#   (same as ``mdcmd -i README.md``).
#
# Options:
#   -i, --inplace / -I, --no-inplace
#                                   Update the file in place
#   --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

<!-- `bmdf -- mktoc --help` -->
```bash
mktoc --help
# Usage: mktoc [OPTIONS] [PATH] [OUT_PATH]
#
#   Build a table of contents from a markdown file.
#
#   If no path is provided, will look for a README.md, and operate "in-place"
#   (same as ``mdcmd -i README.md``).
#
# Options:
#   -i, --inplace / -I, --no-inplace
#                                   Edit the file in-place
#   -n, --indent-size INTEGER       Indent size (spaces)
#   --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

(these blocks are self-hosted, using `bmdf` and `mdcmd`; likewise [the table of contents up top](#toc), via `mktoc` ðŸ˜Ž)
